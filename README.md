Lemacs
======

Lemacs turns conversation into collaboration. It is a social network in the spirit of Twitter, built on top of the GitHub workflow. (But, [why?](https://github.com/lemurs/Lemacs/wiki/Why))


## The Future

This project will eventually work with any repository, and indeed across repositories, but before that feature is implemented, the project will be forked into a separate white label product for organizations to help their people use a single repo.

The trial repo and first user of the white label product will Appsterdam.
